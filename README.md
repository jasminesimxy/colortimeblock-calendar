# <colortimeblock-calendar>

## Description

My motivation for this project was to understand and apply my existing knowledge that I have accumulated for the past 5 weeks and my new knowledge of 3rd party API and jQuery elements into the codes, the concept of "get item" and "set item" data into the local storage of the browser, allowing the correct color block for past,present and future to correlated to the current time.

I completed building this project with prewritten started codes provided because I want it to be easily accessible for anyone to enter and save their calendar notes on the time they've selected. Additionally, users are able to refresh the page without having their input local data being removed and the colors are correlated to the past, present and future time frama color blocks.
